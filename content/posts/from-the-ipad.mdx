I have been designing user interfaces for a really long time. So long, they didn't even have apps or tools when I started out. 

Back in 1994 I was building websites for Loyola Medical Center. At the time, it was the largest medical education website in the world, and possibly the only. We used to email NCSA (the home of Mosaic, the only graphical web browsers available) whenever we updated our site, and they would update their home page. That's right. The web was handled manually back then, but one or two people.

To build web pages, you wrote HTML by hand with TextEdit (the free text editor that came with all Macs pre OS X) and just opened it in the browser to see how it looked. 

This sucked. So I wrote my own editor first using [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard), then I switched to [FileMaker Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileMaker). Both tools let me wrap HTML tags around text and spit out a web page. 

Eventually apps for creating web pages and web sites came out and I was first in line to use them. Some oldies, but goodies...
- PageMill & SiteMill
- Claris Homepage
- NetObjects
- GoLive
- Dreamweaver

Back then, building web sites was really a one, to two person job. You were called a "Webmaster", a really dorky name. 

As web development got more complicated, roles became more specialized. The first websites were 100% static. Then came PERL and CGI-Scripts. JavaScript and Java snuck in sometime after that. 

With or without tools most website design, or upfront planning was done with tools that were never intended for User Interface design (just like HTML, which was is a document markup language). 

## My tool chain over the years.

### 1994 - 1999 the Webmaster Years
Even though I knew HTML and some programming, I did all my UI and Web Design with a combination of Photoshop and Illustrator. Adobe introduced layers in Photoshop in 1995, and that was a game changer. 
- Adobe Photoshop
- HTML editors (see above)
- Adobe Illustrator (for line art that was usually rendered in Photoshop later)
- Debabelizer to reduce the file sizes and adjust images down to the limited 214 color palette of the web, plus you could use it to make Animated GIFs.
- FutureSplash -> Macromedia Flash vector based animation
- Director because Shockwave was going to totally displace HTML. Didn't happen.

This timeframe also saw the arrival of full blown content management systems. Tools like Web Objects, Vingette, Blue Martini etc. came along with their hefty license fees, and army of consultants. They promised to do everything, but took so long to stand up, most startups ran out of money before their sites were launched. 

### 1999 - 2004 The Information Architecture Years
I was still using some of the aforementioned tools for a few more years, but the advent of CSS and JavaScript made it possible to do more and more design programmatically. This too was a game changer because I cold start to design and implement working code that could be passed on to development. Before then, it was mock stuff up in Photoshop, chop it up until little tiny pieces, called slices, and pray the dev team could stitch it back together the way you wanted it. This era was the golden age of WYSIWYG editors that generated so-called usable code. Even though developers mostly threw out what was generated and built their own thing s from scratch. 

### 2005 - 2013 The Front End Developer Years
By this point, Apple was well on their way to be the behemoth we know today. Everyone in Web development used a PowerBook, now called a MacBook. "It has to work in IE" was starting to become less and less of a thing. Now that CSS really worked, web development really sped up. The web was now more of an app delivery platform as well as content. Apps like Basecamps showed the world you could have a really slick looking experience using 99% CSS. So for a while, that start text-heavy look dominated web design. People were still using things like Photoshop to design websites, but it was overkill designs that were mostly rectangles and fonts. Plus, Javascript frameworks and Libraries like ExtJS, YUI, and JQuery, to name a few, were making it easier to assemble websites with chunks of code. Another major influence during this time were open source CMS tools like Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla and Django. These environments made it relatively easy to stand up a website in hours. These platforms with their weird abstractions and PHP jankiness made CSS mandatory. 

### 2014 - 2016 The Full-Stack Years
Visual Design tools made a comeback in this timeframe, and seem to be still going. Designers were getting more adept at what made web development and UI design different that traditional print etc. So we started to see apps like Sketch and Azure (probably older) that were design specifically to do User Interface design. They implemented features like Symbols, or reusable instances of a design element. I took a shine to these tools at first. With them, I was able to design UIs that were closer to how code actually worked. They also had small features that save tons of production time like exporting multiple resolutions.
