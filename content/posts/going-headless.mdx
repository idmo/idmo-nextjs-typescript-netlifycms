After countless attempts to start a new website, I finally got my head wrapped around a headless CMS solution I think will work best for may needs. 

I have been using WordPress for 10-15 years and just had enough. Don't get me wrong, I have more good things to say about the platform than bad. It's just that I feel there are better ways now to manage websites. 

Following are some of the reasons I switched to headlessâ€¦

* I do not need a database
* The published site is blazing fast
* I don't want or need an over-engineered writing experience

Besides these general points, there area bunch of specific ones as well.

This is still pretty buggy.

I'm not sure what this gets me other than an editor I can use on my iPad and even that isn't great.
